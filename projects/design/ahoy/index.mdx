## Overview

Ahoy was a platform for bringing ideas to life. The four of us at Ahoy Labs raised a $2.5M seed round and went to work.

## Role

I led design and wrote copy, though all four of us worked closely on everything. Because we were building a decentralized crowdfunding app on crypto – pretty much uncharted territory – we had to.

## What I Learned

All of my projects up to this point were solo or commissioned by people who were not opinionated about design. Learning to organize, communicate, and align my vision with a team was a steep learning curve, but it was rewarding.

## Result

Ahoy never came to fruition, and after 8-months of work we had no choice but to move on. There’s a deep lesson here: building needs to be a done in tight feedback loops with the eventual user.
