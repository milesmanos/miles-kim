Westwave Capital came to me with a list of portfolio companies and the need to present themselves as a formidable firm to potential portfolio companies and limited partners.

I talked in depth with Rohan to strategize the site’s content. While a lot of small VC firms try to depersonalize and look overly “official,” I decided to lean into their strengths as a small, hands-on team of former entrepreneurs. They still use my tagline: “Deep tech takes deep partnerships.”
