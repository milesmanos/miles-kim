## Overview

Pliny is a platform for people to create, share, and remix AI apps. It provides a lightweight interface to turn prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) into shareable apps.

## Role

The usual: design, copywriting, and frontend development. This was my last project at Ahoy Labs, a small startup that I founded in January 2022. We were in a phase of rapid experimentation, and this was one of several products that I designed during a 3-month period.

## What I Learned

Our team always built quick, but this was extreme â€“ a matter of a couple weeks. AI was moving fast, and we wanted to put this out asap. Figuring out priorities and iterating in tight loops takes grit, determination, and focus.
