## Overview

Gildable was an NFT platform. Instagram influencers could sign up to turn their posts into collectible trading cards.

## Role

After working on UX wireframes, I was brought on as Head of Product. I took their concept – a celebrity trading card platform backed by the blockchain – and readied for launch, taking it from 0 to 1. This involved intense work with developers and very short timelines.

## What I learned

As my first full product, this was a complete doozy. I had to fight for my point of view, which was that the product should be simple. In the end, it still wasn’t simple enough. The product doesn’t exist anymore, but it set the foundation for all of my work since. Thanks to Brody West for taking a chance on me.
