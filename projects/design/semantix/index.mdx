While Semantix has a gigantic presence in Brazil, they were looking to launch a new suite of AI-centric products in the U.S. As the sole designer, I was given tons of autonomy, working closely with the CTO to set product vision.
Because I was given little-to-no instruction from the design leads in Brazil – not even so much as a style guide – I learned to make use of few resources and work directly with my team to deliver results.
